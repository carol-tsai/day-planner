## Description

When handling sensitive information, it is important to protect our information using strong passwords. This application will generate a random, secure password given the inputs of password length and types you characters you want to include. The application will ask you for the parameters for your password using window prompts and confims. Using this application will help you to ensure that your information is protected with secure passwords.

### What I learned
While doing this project I learned to get current dates and times using the moment.js API. I also got comfortable with using jQuery methods and Bootstrap classes to format the document.

## Usage

The webpage can be found at [this link](https://carol-tsai.github.io/password-generator/)

Upon load the page, the header will display the current date. 

When you scroll down, there will be a time table for regular business hours. The hours that are in the past will be colored gray, the current hour will be red, and the remaining hours in the workday will be green. 

To enter something into the planner, click the colored box and type in your info. Click the save button to save your plans to your browser storage. Now when you return to the page, you planner will automatically be updated with your plans.

## Credits

Code for the index.html and stylesheet files was copied from UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp course material.
