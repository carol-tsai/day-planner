# Day Planner

## Description

As a working professional, it is important to be able to track different tasks and events throughout the day in order to work well with your collegues and get tasks done in a timely fashion. This can be aided with a work day planner. This application is a day planner where you can input your events and tasks during regular business hours. Your plans will be saved in the browser so that you do not have to worry about keeping the application open. You can feel free to leave and return without fear of losing your plans.

### What I learned
While doing this project I learned to get current dates and times using the moment.js API. I also got comfortable with using jQuery methods and Bootstrap classes to format the document.

## Usage

The webpage can be found at [this link](https://carol-tsai.github.io/day-planner/)

Upon load the page, the header will display the current date.

When you scroll down, there will be a time table for regular business hours. The hours that are in the past will be colored gray, the current hour will be red, and the remaining hours in the workday will be green.

To enter something into the planner, click the colored box and type in your info. Click the save button to save your plans to your browser storage. Now when you return to the page, you planner will automatically be updated with your plans.
